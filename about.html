          <h2>What is a credit card generator?</h2>
          <p>
            With the click of a button, you may use this straightforward
            web-based program to instantly generate a realistic, entirely random
            credit cards. Or even browse through our collection of various
            designs.
          </p>
          <h2>Can I buy things with the generated card?</h2>
          <p>
            No. The numbers generated by our website are actual in that they
            abide by all the guidelines for a legitimate credit card number.
            This incorporates Luhn's algorithm.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, these numbers are not connected to a legitimate credit card
            account, thus there is no money available for purchases.
          </p>
          <h2>What can I do with these cards?</h2>
          <p>
            A random credit card number cannot be used to make purchases, but it
            can be used for a variety of other things:
          </p>
          <p>
            Free trials: When the trial expires, there will be no charges and
            the account will close itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            In testing, programmers use fictitious credit card information to
            check the functionality of e-commerce websites and other services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Registration: A valid credit card number is required for some free
            registrations. To obtain a legitimate number without giving out
            unneeded personal information, use our credit card generator.
